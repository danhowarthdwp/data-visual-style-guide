      <p>Used to colour multiple individual data points, or entire graphs, and make them distinguishable. Applied in sequence to create contrast between adjoining colours which aid with vision deficiencies.</p>

      <p>Although eight colours are provided a limit of four categories is advised to prevent a chart becoming too cluttered. Please consider your data representation carefully.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Overarching</h2>

      <p>These exist as a palette to select individual colours to standardise text, backgrounds, etc. It is made up of the text, label, axis, Categorical, and prominent Sequential colours.</p>

      <p>Care must be taken to use these colours in line with the guidelines, e.g. the yellow focus colour should not be used outside of highlighting a focussed element.</p>

      <p>Discrepancies in usage will dilute the representation of the meanings associated with the colours.</p>
